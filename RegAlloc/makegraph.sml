(* The "instrs2graph" function takes a list of assembly instructions,
   and constructs its flowgraph and also returns the list of nodes in 
   the flowgraph. The instructions exactly correspond to the nodes in 
   the graph. If instruction m can be followed by instruction n (either
   by a jump or by falling through), there should be an edge from m to n
   in the graph.

   The flowgraph also maintains several attributes for each node in the 
   graph, i.e., the "def" set, the "use" set, and the "ismove" flag
