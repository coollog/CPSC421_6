<i> what you have done so far

I have written all the parts of CodeGen but have not tested anything. Hopefully,
but most likely not, it does what it should do.

<ii> how other groups would use your code (i.e., the bin files) ?

Just plug the code into 'sources.cm', or copy it into your CodeGen folder.
In main.sml, you will need to call procEntryExit using the RegAlloc part. I do
not know how this works yet either.

<iii> what assumptions you have made about your current implementations ?

None, or I do not know which are assumptions.

<iv> what desirable features you would like other groups to work on ?

Just make it work?

<v> if you have changed more files than required, explain it here.
