<i> what you have done so far

I have written all the parts of CodeGen and successfully tested against all the
provided tests. The code has been documented thoroughly.

<ii> how other groups would use your code (i.e., the bin files) ?

Just plug the code into 'sources.cm', or copy it into your CodeGen folder.
In main.sml, you will need to call procEntryExit using the RegAlloc part.

To compile:
  gcc -m32 -o <executable> runtime.c <assembly code>

<iii> what assumptions you have made about your current implementations ?

- All memory used as 4-bytes.
- Itreegen does not push arguments for CALL, Codegen does.

<iv> what desirable features you would like other groups to work on ?

All done, no more features needed.

<v> if you have changed more files than required, explain it here.
