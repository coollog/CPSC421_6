What works:
Reasonable looking ITree's are successfully generated for all test cases in
the tests/ directory.

What doesn't work:
There are almost certainly some bugs with the internal details of Frame.
This includes static link placement and following, parameter offsets, and
local variable offsets. I have marked areas that I suspect may be wrong
with TODO.
