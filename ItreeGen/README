1. I have finished implementing and calling the functions to generate the
   Translate gexps except for function declarations. Other than that, I
   need to fix/fill in some details in Frame.

2. Other groups would use my code by either copying my ITreeGen files into
   their own code, or by changing sources.cm to point to my files. After
   creating a struct Semant = SemantGen(REGISTER structure here), the function
   Semant.transprog prog will generate a list of Frame.frags.

3. My current implementation does not properly generate function declarations.
   It also assumes all variables escape and are stored in the frame.

4. I would like other groups to make their parts work.

5. N/A
